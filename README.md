# PurifAI üßπ‚ú®

An AI-powered data cleaning tool with intelligent imputation, robust outlier detection, and comprehensive quality control reporting.

## üéØ Overview

**PurifAI** is an AI-assisted data cleaning tool that empowers users to upload raw CSV files and apply a suite of sophisticated algorithms to improve data quality. It automates the detection of outliers and the imputation of missing values, culminating in a professional, multi-page PDF report with rich visualizations that detail the entire cleaning process and its impact on the dataset.

This project was developed for **Statathon 2025**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Frontend (React):**
* `UploadPage.jsx`: File upload interface with method selection.
* `ResultsPage.jsx`: Displays a QC summary and download links for all generated files.
* `UserGuide.jsx`: A comprehensive guide explaining the tool's features and methods.
* `App.js`: Handles routing between the application's pages.
* `enhanced-styles.css`: A modern, responsive dark theme.

### **Backend (FastAPI):**
* `main.py`: Handles file processing, all data cleaning logic, visualization, and report generation.
* Creates three types of outputs: a cleaned CSV, a QC JSON summary, and a multi-page PDF report.
* CORS enabled for seamless frontend-backend communication.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1.  **ü§ñ Advanced Outlier Detection**: Choose from three industry-standard algorithms:
    * **IQR (Interquartile Range)**
    * **Z-Score**
    * **Isolation Forest** (Machine Learning)
2.  **üß† Intelligent Imputation**: Select from three methods to handle missing values:
    * **Mean**
    * **Median**
    * **k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)** (Machine Learning)
3.  **üìä Professional PDF Reporting**: Automatically generates a detailed report with:
    * High-level cleaning summary.
    * In-depth analysis and visualizations of the **original** dataset.
    * A "before and after" comparison to show the impact of cleaning.
    * A full analysis and visualizations of the **final, cleaned** dataset.
4.  **üìÅ Multiple Export Formats**: Download the cleaned data (CSV), a technical summary (JSON), and the full analytical report (PDF).
5.  **üé® Modern UI**: A responsive dark theme that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlphaNOVA23/purifai.git
   cd purifai
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a New React App**
```bash
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
```
- this will create a new frontend folder

4. **Install Node.js dependencies in the frontend folder**
   ```bash
   npm install react react-dom react-router-dom
   ```

5.**Copy Frontend Files**
 - After creating the React app, copy all files from the provided frontend files folder into the src folder within your newly created React app directory (`frontend`). This will replace the default files with your custom application files.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI backend**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìù Usage

### Step 1: Upload Dataset
* Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse.
* Choose your preferred outlier detection and imputation methods.
* Click "Start Cleaning" to begin the process.

### Step 2: Review Results
* View the quality control summary with before/after statistics.
* See which methods were applied to your data.

### Step 3: Download Outputs
* **Cleaned CSV**: Your dataset with outliers handled and missing values filled.
* **QC JSON**: A technical report with detailed statistics.
* **PDF Report**: The professional, multi-page summary with all visualizations.

## üìä Sample Data

The repository includes test datasets with missing values.

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### `POST /process`
Upload and process a CSV file.

* **Request:** Multipart form data with a CSV file and the selected `outlier_method` and `imputation_method`.
* **Response:** JSON with a QC summary and references to the downloadable files.

### `GET /download/{filename}`
Download the processed files (CSV, JSON, or PDF).

* **Parameters:** `filename` - The name of the file to download.
* **Response:** The requested file.

### `GET /health`
A health check endpoint for the backend.

* **Response:** `{"status": "ok"}`

## üß™ Testing
